# counter_to_lcd

Simple counter design for spartan E3 board displaying the numbers in an lcd display.
The counter has 2 running functions, ascending and descending, 4 different speeds and the ability to pause and reset.
This is a project created for a University course.

The lcd_controller.vhd is not my work and can be found [here](https://github.com/Maeur1/16x2-LCD-Controller-VHDL).
